1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

You can ensure that your code is functional and secure by using various software tesing techniques. Using these techniques can help you to identify any problems that may arise in while using the program. By catching these errors before the software goes live you can prevent any security threats or software failures from occuring. Using techniques such as the JUnit testing like I used in this project you can save time by automatically testing and it will also allow you to test frequently. It is also important to make sure you are following the requirements given you can ensure that you program is meeting the expectations that the client and users have for the program. However, making sure that your code is free from error is vital while writing code since errors will cause issues with the software and could potentially leak important user information. 
   
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is extremely important in programming. While writing a code it is vital that you include all the features that are wanted by the user. In order to do this it is important that you first understand the requirements given for the program. Understanding the requirements will help you to create a program that meets the needs of the client and the users. Using techniques such as user stories can help you to implement the needs and wants of the user into your program. User needs can also help to identify what parts of the program works and what parts need improvement. By understanding these things you can create a program that runs as expected and is also easy to use for the user. 
   
3. How do I approach designing software?

When approaching the design aspect of creating software I first start by looking at the requirements given by the client. Understanding the requirements given helps me to understand what is wanted from the program. Once I understand the requirements that are given I like to write the program piece by piece. By writing the program in smaller pieces and winging them together I can give each of these sections my full attention. After working on a section that I feel confident about I will move onto the next piece and continue this process.
